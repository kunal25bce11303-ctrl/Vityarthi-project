Python Calculator
This repository contains a simple command-line calculator implemented in Python. It supports a variety of binary, unary, and constant mathematical operations.

Features
Binary Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Exponentiation.
Unary Operations: Natural Logarithm (ln), Logarithm base 10 (log10), Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Cotangent, Secant, Cosecant, Exponential, Square Root, Factorial, and various Inverse Trigonometric functions.
Constants: Pi (π) and Euler's number (e).
Interactive Menu: Guides the user through operation selection and input.
How to Use
Run the script: Execute the Python script from your terminal.

python calculator.py
Select an operation: The calculator will display a menu of operations. Enter the number corresponding to your desired operation.

========================================
*** Binary Operations ***
========================================
1. add()
2. sub()
3. mult()
4. div()
16. xexpy()

... (and so on)
Provide inputs:

For binary operations (e.g., addition), you will be prompted for two inputs.
For unary operations (e.g., sine), you will be prompted for one input.
For constants (e.g., Pi), no input is required.
View the result: The calculator will display the result of the chosen operation.

Enter your choice:1
